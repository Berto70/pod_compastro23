    "## Conclusions\n",
    "From the comparison of the two cases we can draw several conclusions:\n",
    "- Eccentric systems can retain more mass for longer times;\n",
    "- For circular orbits, the conservative condition of $2\\,r_t$ gives a lower bound for the gravitationally bound condition. A more precise limit is given by the particles' total energy.  \n",
    "  While for eccentric orbits, $r_t$ and $2\\, r_t$ give a lower and an upper bound respectively, so an intermediated radius $r_t<r<2\\,r_t$ can be found as a proxy for the gravitationally bound condition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In both cases, the inner layers are decoupled from the external ones. This means that while the external regions expand due to tidal forces and lose mass (making the 90% mass radius shrink as time passes), the internal regions remain roughly the same size. The process is the same but with different timescales, depending on the moment the cumulative mass loss becomes to be significant (i.e. $>80\\%$). \n",
    "- The dispersion of the tangential velocity, in Fig. 6, presents a similar behavior in both cases, only on different timescales. The three phases, that we identified, are a fast increase in velocity dispersion, a mixing of the inner layers' velocities and a stripping of the outer layers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Future works should investigate the dependencies of using the tidal radius condition for electing gravitationally bound stars, depending on the eccentricities of the orbits.  \n",
    "  A more robust statistical analysis should be run in order to study the overlapping of the tangential velocities distribution, considering, for example, the 95% credibility interval."
