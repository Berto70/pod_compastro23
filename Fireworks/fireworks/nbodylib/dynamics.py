====================================================================================================================
Collection of functions to estimate the Gravitational forces and accelerations (:mod:`fireworks.nbodylib.dynamics`)
====================================================================================================================

This module contains a collection of functions to estimate acceleration due to
gravitational  forces.

Each method implemented in this module should follow the input-output structure show for the
template function  :func:`~acceleration_estimate_template`:

Every function needs to have two input parameters:

    - particles, that is an instance of the class :class:`~fireworks.particles.Particles`
    - softening, it is the gravitational softening. The parameters need to be included even
        if the function is not using it. Use a default value of 0.

The function needs to return a tuple containing three elements:

    - acc, the acceleration estimated for each particle, it needs to be a Nx3 numpy array,
        this element is mandatory it cannot be 0.
    - jerk, time derivative of the acceleration, it is an optional value, if the method
        does not estimate it, just set this element to None. If it is not None, it has
        to be a Nx3 numpy array.
    - pot, gravitational potential at the position of each particle. it is an optional value, if the method
        does not estimate it, just set this element to None. If it is not None, it has
        to be a Nx1 numpy array.
