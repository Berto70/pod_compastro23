# Multievo
Script using `multiprocessing`library to run multiple evolutions in parallel. 

* `final_multievo_experiments.py` creates multiple timings data and comparison plots. 
* `bash_multievo_experiments.sh`runs the multiple experiments iteratevely.
* `comparison_plot.jpg` shows the resulting orbits for different integrators, comparing the serial and parallel simulations
* `multievo_plots.ipynb` is used to creates the final plots of the timings that will be presented in the final report.
* `parallel_vs_serial_ONESTEP.csv`is the data file used for the plots.
* `parallel_vs_serial.pdf` is the plot shown in the report
